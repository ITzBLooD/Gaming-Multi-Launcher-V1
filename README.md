# Gaming-Multi-Launcher-Beta V1.1 (Updated on 17/3/2021 2:30PM GMT+4)
A Launcher for launching multiple gaming launchers

1- My Multi-App Launcher serves the purpose of saving time launching applications, as well as saving desktop space. 
   It's developed to simplify our lives as gamers by combining many launchers we use as gamers in one application.

3- This launcher is my first published app, this means that you might find issues or bugs while using it.

4- Some features of this appliciation are:

	- Choose the locations of the exe files for the applications you want to launch.

	- You can change the background of the app to the one you desire.

	- To contact me if you find any issues or bugs, or just want to suggest any new idea or feature, or even just chat.

	- If you would like to support me as a new developer, there is a Paypal button which takes you to my profile.

5- Some known problems (might not be lol):
	
	- The target location of the chosen file will reset if you click on "Select" -> choose any one, then you click "Cancel".

6- V1.1 Update notes:

	- Fixed the issue of crashing when you accidentally delete the "Paths" folder by re-creating the folder on the next launch 
	  and restarting the launcher automatically for you.
	- Removed the Welcome message just not to annoy the user all over again and again.

7- Thank you, Enjoy using my Launcher!!
