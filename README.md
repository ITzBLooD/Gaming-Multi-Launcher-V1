# Gaming-Multi-Launcher-V1
A Launcher for launching multiple gaming launchers

1- My Multi-App Launcher serves the purpose of saving time launching applications, as well as saving desktop space. It's developed to simplify our lives as gamers.

3- This launcher is my first published app, this means that you might find issues or bugs while using it.

4- Some features of this appliciation are:

	- Choose the locations of the exe files for the applications you want to launch.

	- You can change the background of the app to the one you desire.

	- To contact me if you find any issues or bugs, or just want to suggest any new idea or feature, or even just chat.

	- If you would like to support me as a new developer, there is a Paypal button which takes you to my profile.

5- Some known problems (might not be lol):
	
	- The target location of the chosen file will reset if you click on "Select" -> choose any one, then you click "Cancel".

6- Thank you, Enjoy using my Launcher!!
